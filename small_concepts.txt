range(starting_no,ending_no,step)                - step is the count that steps from starting no to next number
                                                   eg: range(2,101,2) gives the multiples of 2 b/w 2 and 101
random.choose(list)                              - to choose a random value from a list
What is parameter and argument                   - something = 123 ------ something is parameter and 123 is a argument
To round a value down to its nearest whole number- math.round(2.3) - gives 2
To round a value up to its nearest whole number  - math.ceil(2.3) - gives 3
To attach one list to another list               - list1.extend(list2)
Global variable                                  - recommend not to change the value to of the global variable.
                                                   naming convention recomm is GLOBAL_VARIABLE (to identify its global)
